# Web Crawler Yelp Restaurant Reviews in Dallas, Sentiment Analysis and Naive Bayes for predicting the sentiment.
  Yelp is a local search service for local businesses. People share their reviews about their experience with that business, which is a very crucial source of information. Customer’s feedback can help identify and prioritize strengths and weaknesses for further development of the business. I am interested in the customer reviews for restaurants near me, location Dallas. 
  By scraping all those reviews we can collect a decent amount of quantitative and qualitative data, analyze it, and identify areas for improvement. And using the Multinomial Naive Bayes for predicting the sentiment.
