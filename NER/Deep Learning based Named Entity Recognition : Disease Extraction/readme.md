# Using Keras to perform Named Entity Recognition for Clinical studies 
  Clinical studies often require detailed patients’ information documented in clinical narratives. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task to extract entities of interest (e.g., disease names, medication names and lab tests) from clinical narratives, thus to support clinical and translational research. important information for clinical research and other healthcare operations, as they depict rich, detailed medical information.

Tools: Pandas, Numpy, tqdm, keras

## Steps:
  Creating Word and Tag dictionary 
  Feature Extraction for Deep learning Model 
  Building Bi-directional LSTM Model 
  Prediction on Test Set
  Writing the submission file 

## Conclusion： 
  I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project “Training Deep Learning based Named Entity Recognition from Scratch : Disease Extraction Hackathon”. https://github.com/PhantomInsights/baby-names-analysis.
