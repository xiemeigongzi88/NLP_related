# Multi-Class Text Classification with Scikit-Learn
  The problem is supervised text classification problem, and our goal is to investigate which supervised machine learning methods are best suited to solve it.
Given a new complaint comes in, we want to assign it to one of 12 categories. The classifier makes the assumption that each new complaint is assigned to one and only one category. This is multi-class text classification problem. I canâ€™t wait to see what we can achieve!
